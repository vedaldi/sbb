# Seebibyte

Seebibyte: Visual Search for the Era of Big Data is a large research
project based in the Department of Engineering Science, University of
Oxford. It is funded by the EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council), and will run from 2015 - 2020.

There are two main objectives:

1. To carry out fundamental research to develop next generation
   computer vision methods that are able to analyse, describe and
   search image and video content with human-like capabilities; and

2. To transfer these methods to industry and to other academic
   disciplines (such as Archaeology, Art, Geology, Medicine, Plant
   sciences and Zoology).
